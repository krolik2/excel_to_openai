# excel_to_openai
Program for loading multiple items from excel file to generate text for each row from OpenAI API. I'm using it for generating products description from a list of product titles.

In order to use this program you need to sign up for your API key from OpenAI and store it in ".env" file inside root directory.
eg: API_KEY="123"
